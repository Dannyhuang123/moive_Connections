The extension file takes three parameters, the first parameter is movie_casts.tsv
, the second parameter is the output file. There is only one column
of third parameter, which is the name. The third parameter is the actor you want
explore. The format of output file should name<tab>number. For example 
Bacon Kevin (I)	11793.

The purpose of extension is to find how many actors are connectly to the input
name not limited to direclty connected actors. Therefore in most of cases, the
output is 11793, which is the total number of actors in movie_casts.tsv minus 1
because actor should not connect to himself. 

warning: The program will use approximately 1 minute for each input name. 
We indirectly prove that all actors are connected to a single graph, because if
we try arbitrary name, the number of actors which are connectd to him is 11793.
Therefore please only use a single actor name per test, otherwise it will take
a long time.

BUT if we use different file other than movie_casts.tsv we will have different
output, but different actors may be in different unconnected graph.

How to run the program:

./extension movie_casts.tsv actor_name.tsv output.txt

The output will be in the format: Bacon, Kevin<tab>number. If you want to see
different result, please use different input file, which not all actors are
connected.
